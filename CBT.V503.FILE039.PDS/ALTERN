The following alternative zap was suggested by Cliff Jackson.

NAME  IPOUPDTE
VER   0548 0A12    SVC 18           BLDL
REP   0548 1BFF    SR  15,15        SET R15 TO ZERO

NAME  CPPUPDTE
VER   055A 0A12    SVC 18           BLDL
REP   055A 1BFF    SR  15,15        SET R15 TO ZERO

That is, instead of testing the result of the FIND or BLDL SVC,
just force the result to always be zero, or "not found", and don't
even do the SVC at all.
