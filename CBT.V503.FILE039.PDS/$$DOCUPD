 This file has members IPOUPDTE and CPPUPDTE, which show you how to
 zap IBM programs IPOUPDTE and CPPUPDTE, so they will run against
 any partitioned dataset--not requiring that there exist a member
 called $$$COIBM in the dataset.  After a FIND macro, you go on,
 no matter what the return code from the FIND.

 I've added the corresponding zap for CPPUPDTE.  (Sam Golob - 10/99)

 See also the ALTERN member for a different zap that has the same
 effect.

 I've copied the replacement for the old CBIPO program MCNVTCAT, a
 REXX called RCNVTCAT from CBT File 542, so you are equipped with the
 latest applicable stuff, right on this file.
